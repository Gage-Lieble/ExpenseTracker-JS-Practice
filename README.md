## Expense Tracker (Basic - Begginner) (Code time 30 mins)
This Javascript based app is a very simple expense tracker that allows the user to input the 'Item', the 'Cost' of the item, and when it was 'Purchased'. The data is stored into an HTML Table that is labeled 'Item' , 'Price'  , and ''Purchase date'. The very light styling that was applied is 100% CSS.
